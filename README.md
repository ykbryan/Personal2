# TIKI-NGON CART SUGGEST SERVICE

This is an example of coding file that I wrote by myself. 
I wrote this service to recommend products for customers who need to add more to their carts, when checking out, to meet min value of order required for shipping discount. This is only applied for grocery categories (called "Tiki-Ngon").
The requirements are:
- Recommending products are in the same store, in-stock, not already in cart, and have good performance.
- The order to display products is based on the gap between their price and min value, and their categories.
